# Grid-Maker 

In this assignment, we are developing a grid-based application with various user functionalities. Users can interact with the grid by selecting actions from a menu, such as adding or removing rows and columns. They can also choose colors from a dropdown menu and apply them to individual cells or entire grids. Additionally, users have the ability to clear all cell colors and restore them to their initial state.
